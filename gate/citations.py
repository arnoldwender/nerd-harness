"""The Nerd Harness gate: every attributed quotation must trace to a source.

    python3 gate/citations.py              # offline checks
    python3 gate/citations.py --online     # also resolve every source URL
    python3 gate/citations.py --sarif out.json

Exit codes are part of the contract shared by the conduct-harness family:

    0   no findings
    1   findings — the repo makes a claim it cannot back
    2   the gate itself failed

The third one is not decoration. A checker that returns 1 when it crashed reads
as "I found something"; one that returns 0 reads as "clean" and fails OPEN —
which is the exact failure NO CARGO CULT never trades. This gate
distinguishes its own failure from its verdict.

WHAT THIS GATE IS FOR
---------------------
`scripts/check.py` already verifies that a quotation printed in the README
exists somewhere in this repo. That catches a README quoting a line the emitter
never emits. It does NOT catch the failure that actually shipped: a quotation
that exists in the pool, is beautifully formatted, and is **not real** — wrong
work, wrong year, wrong author, or invented outright.

Four of the ten public harnesses shipped fabricated citations. Two dated
metadata errors got past every human reader:

  * "Sir Edwin Arnold, The Song Celestial (1885)" — Arnold was knighted in 1888,
    so the honorific is three years early.
  * Newton, "Principia (1687)", Rule I — in the 1687 edition that passage is
    *Hypothesis I*. It only becomes Regula I in the second edition of 1713.

Neither is catchable by grep. Both are catchable by arithmetic against the
author's dates and the edition history, which is what CHECK 3 does.

A repo whose third discipline is NO CARGO CULT — "invent nothing: no
fabricated flag, number, API, benchmark, or citation" — cannot ship a
citation nobody can test.

    distinction is the difference between a gate people keep and one they rip out.

    THE DELIMITER IS THE DISCRIMINANT, and it was learned the hard way. The first
    version of this function treated "blockquote containing an em dash" as a
    citation, and fired on two lines of the repo's own prose:

        > The first utterance … from the empiricist canon — Bacon, Newton, Huxley.
        > Four pillars … — and every rule earns its place by carrying a way to
        > prove it broken.

    Both are prose that happens to contain an em dash. Neither is a quotation.
    A real citation is always *delimited* — wrapped in quotation marks or in
    italics — because that is how a quotation is set off from the sentence
    around it. Requiring the delimiter drops both false positives and keeps all
    fifteen real quotations. A gate with a 12% false-positive rate on its own
